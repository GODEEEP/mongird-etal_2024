## Abstract

Transitioning towards a decarbonized power grid and net-zero economy will require unprecedented expansion of energy infrastructure, leading to extensive development footprints and land use conversion. Understanding where future power plant sitings are likely to take place and identifying the potential conflicts and land-use tradeoffs that may arise will be key to identifying feasible pathways and evaluating regional planning coordination needs. Through spatially explicit integrated modeling we develop projected 1 km2 resolution power plant sitings in the Western United States (US) for both business-as-usual and net zero pathways. We find that 30% more land will be needed for solar and wind infrastructure to achieve a net zero economy compared to a business-as-usual economy and that 75% of that development is projected to be located within 10 km of natural areas. Additionally, we find California to be the most vulnerable Western US state to evolving siting constraints.

## Reproduce my analysis
Clone this repository to get access to the notebooks used to conduct the analysis. You'll also need 
to download the input files into the `data/input_data` directory. Each notebook that requires input data will specify where to download the data. 
Once you have the input datasets downloaded you can use the following 
notebooks to rerun the analysis and produce the post-processed data. 

To complete the analysis end to end, run the following notebooks:
